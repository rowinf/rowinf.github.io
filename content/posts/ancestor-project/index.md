## What is Ancestry Project (The Animus)

Part fiction, part genealogy, part emotional technology — Ancestry Project is metamodernism in code.

This post details Ancestry Project (The Animus) that uses Google's Gemini tools to create an interactive choose-your-own adventure that you can run as one of your own ancestors.

## Empathy for the Past
> The full saying goes: love your neighbor *as you love yourself*\
> Empathy is the balm for xenophobia, softening the fear of the stranger\
> Hiding in its shadow is oikophobia: the fear of one's own.\
> When we see the past only in shadow, we inherit disconnection.\
> But to imagine our ancestors as extraordinary...\
> to see their humanity in both achievement and failure\
> is to begin the long work of reunion\
> Empathy does not excuse.\
> It listens. It remembers. It makes us kin again.\
> Love for the other and the self, balance restored.

## Why This Matters Now
Postmodern thought taught us to question power\
to see how history is written by the victors\
how memory bends under the weight of empire, institution, and ideology

But when we use empathy to imagine our ancestors\
not as symbols\
but as people with dreams, flaws, and quiet resilience\
we reclaim a kind of power too

Not the power to dominate\
but the power to belong\
To see ourselves in the past\
and to resist the story that says we come from nothing worth remembering

In the ruins of grand narratives\
we plant personal ones\
This too is resistance

## Notes

It was inspired by a machine from the game series Assassin's Creed called The Animus that decodes memories in your DNA to provide an immersive virtual reality experience as one of your ancestors. In the game, you do this to solve present-day mysteries.

My reason for doing this is developing empathy for the past. Trying to imagine living an ancestor's life may help us feel less isolated from our past, and build connections in the present. There's [some research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3559433/) suggesting fiction can be a tool for developing empathy.
