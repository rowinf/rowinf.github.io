This is a simple static website with recipes I've collected over some years. I find it useful to refer back to a favorite recipe without having to go through the trouble of bookmarks or finding websites again.

I use a markdown editor to take down the essentials from the recipe website. You might notice a Rakefile with a build task. It copies the text I've written to this project, adding some metadata.
