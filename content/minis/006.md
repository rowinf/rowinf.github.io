React's revolution in the world of software engineering finally reaches its end stage by becoming what it originally set out to replace: A full-stack web framework. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.

## Attention Economy

React has solidly entered the awkward space of being the most popular, boring framework for making web applications. It most recently became a full stack framework with the introduction of server components. Nextjs basically is React, now that the React documentation recommends using a full-stack framework with React. I found Remix very pleasant to work with too, so it's in the mix as a distant second.

The [state of JS survey](https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/) reveals that interest in React has been declining since 2016. It remains the most popular front end frameworks **in use** among survey respondents. But people are losing interest.

Meanwhile, many other options are entering the idea-space. Many are asking [if not React, then what](https://infrequently.org/2024/11/if-not-react-then-what/)?

Will 2025 be the year React becomes *uninteresting*?
