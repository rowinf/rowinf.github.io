The php ecosystem has undergone many changes in just this year.
Laravel 12 was released along with new starter kits.
Livewire is new too. A way to enhance normal html with attributes.
Livewire has become the default standard in Laravel, with Volt along with it.
Livewire is one of many ways to enhance plain html with framework-specific attributes to add reactivity and other behavior.

I had been a Rails dev for something like 3 years, and I still occasionally attend the local ruby meetup.
I was used to Rails already. Laravel is like Rails, but with php. Laravel is almost its own language though, php is just the syntax.
The real benefit from Laravel comes from the cohesiveness of the ecosystem, the easy path to production, and each step along the way has a command line generator.

The Notes project from frontendmentor.io looked like a good sized challenge to test my skills and learn a new framework.

Testing one's skills and learning something new could be considered multitasking.
In this case I was learning Livewire and Tailwind CSS.

Laravel is well-known to the various AI chat bots. I'm not using an AI powered editor yet, but pretty much every question had an answer.
