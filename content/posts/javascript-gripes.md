I just want to note these gripes here before I can move on to writing about other things because
I want to reference it later.

I've been a JavaScript developer for a long time, my head was spinning after the ECMAScript module change,
and then React server components were released.

## Starting all over again

Even though I had worked on React and Next.js for a long time, if i started a new project,
it would look nothing like the ones I had been working on up until recently.
The packages I worked with before could become abandoned in the post-RSC world.
It happend to [styled components](https://github.com/orgs/styled-components/discussions/5568).
I felt like I was starting over again, and might as well learn something new.

I've worked on several React projects and they had almost nothing in common.
Calling something a React app is a bit weird because React is just one part of a patchwork solution.
Every couple of years, a big change in React is released, and the patchwork comes apart in places.
There is then a period of uncertainty and invention as a new patchwork comes together.

Furthermore, there are a lot of different ways to use React. Since React is just a slice of a stack, and nearly everyone knows React, someone with a lot of React experience might find that React alone just isn't good enough.

## Path to production

As far as I can tell, deploying a JavaScript application is tricky, and many people choose specialized cloud platforms and back-end as a service platforms. There are lots of them. I'm not familiar with the ins and outs of these platforms, and they all do very similar things, many with generous free tiers. I haven't personally gone very far down this route, but it feels like vendor lock-in everywhere I look.

## The JavaScript herd

I nod my head in approval as I read the [Epic stack](https://www.epicweb.dev/epic-stack) essay.
An opinionated, prescriptive JavaScript stack that gives you everything you might possibly need?
Analysis paralysis is a big problem in JS world, and Epic stack looks great as a solution to that.
I like Remix and Epic Stack, but it's hard to gauge how that project will go.
A framework is only as strong as the community behind it.
The JS community seems to follow the herd over any project or individual.
Keep up or be left behind.

## Framework as Community

The productivity boost of a framework helps, but really a framework is a way to build community in the software world. People come together to share knowledge, stories, and work together. Frameworks give us a shared context to work from. The framework I choose is going in its own direction, and my project is just along for the ride, so it's important to choose well, but having
others on the journey is the best part of software development.

## Communities Fracture

When a community changes too much it starts to fracture. The left-behind herd members find different herds. Secondly, a community interest can become too universal that it stops being meaningful. A community can suffer from a lack of differentiation, to the point that it offers few advantages to its members, that it may as well not exist. The JavaScript community problem may not be fixed, but I will be keeping an eye on this space.
