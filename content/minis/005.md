Most ideas stay up in imagination land, unrealized. Nearly all ideas are bad and belong there, but some are good and stay there anyway. Some are good and become realized, they find their way into the real world. They are enacted through people.

An office worker can have many dreams, yet stays in place. Maybe they're waiting for something. Just want to run their own business, reads about it every day. Too risky. Never acts.

Luxury beliefs. Hypocrites. Armchair thinkers waiting for someone to turn their ideas a reality. They never put themselves at risk to see the consequences of their own beliefs.

It takes time and effort to bring ideas from idea-space into reality, both of which are finite resources. Resources take time to use, adding another constraint.
