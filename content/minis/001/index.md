Art changed so much around the turn of the 20th century. I chose some images from myths found on [oldbookillustrations.com](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/) to compare with one another. really see them become more "modern" even as the same mythology source material is used.

### Perseus & the Gorgons
Sampled from the [1890s](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/perseus-gorgons/). To contrast with the others, note the bold lines and dramatic posturing.
{{< figure src="perseus-gorgons-768.jpg" title="Perseus stands on a rocky shoreline, still wielding his sword as he holds Medusa's severed head in his arms. The two surviving gorgons crawl the ground, seemingly stricken with terror while Medusa's headless body lies in the forefront." link="perseus-gorgons-768.jpg" data-pswp-width="250" data-pswp-height="768" height="450" width="313" >}}

### If Orpheus Produced the Waltz
Lifted from the [1900s](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/orpheus/)
{{< figure src="orpheus-768.jpg" title="A young man plays the flute in the foreground, while three couples are dancing to the music in a landscape with mountains overlooking a stretch of water. One of the couples consists of a young woman and a satyr, another of a young woman and a tree, and the third of two dogs." link="orpheus-768.jpg" data-pswp-width="250" data-pswp-height="768" height="450" width="313" >}} 

### Changed into Swans
Published in the [1910s](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/changed-into-swans/)
{{< figure src="changed-into-swans-768.jpg" title="A woman wearing a crown stands as though waving at swans flocking around her. This picture is an illustration for the tale, 'The Six Swans.'" link="changed-into-swans-768.jpg" data-pswp-width="250" data-pswp-height="768" height="450" width="313" >}} 

### What Is It?
Drawn in the [1920s](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/jason-asked/). The lines are noticeably more refined and sharper. Here the scene is calmer and more restrained than the earlier works.

{{< figure src="jason-asked-768.jpg" title="Jason, dressed as a hoplite, points his finger toward the Golden Fleece glowing in the distance while Medea stands at his side at the entrance of Adelphi." link="jason-asked-768.jpg" data-pswp-width="250" data-pswp-height="768" height="450" width="313" >}}
