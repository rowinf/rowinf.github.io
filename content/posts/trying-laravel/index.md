After a long time as a JavaScript developer, I developed too many issues with React [noted here]({{< ref "posts/javascript-gripes" >}})



The few years of Rails experience I had led me back to want to go back to Rails
but I find Rails positions are more scarce than they once were, and there seem to be more than enough super-senior
Rails devs floating around to land them. If I'm going to learn Laravel it had to be for my own solo dev
benefit and not because I'm looking for a job, because probably there are enough super-senior laravel devs out there
to meet the demand.

I saw that Laravel:
- has the best aspects of Rails
- it is a little more popular than Rails
- has a dynamic and friendly community

Recent updates I noticed while undergoing this project:
- Laravel 12 released
- New starter kits with Livewire
- VS Code extension
- Laravel Cloud was launched

## Laravel Livewire

Livewire comes bundled with Alpine.js (I know Alpine!).
Livewire is one of many new ways to enhance plain html with framework-specific attributes to add reactivity and other behavior.

## Front end mentor

The Notes project from frontendmentor.io looked like a good sized challenge to test my skills and learn a new framework.


Testing one's skills and learning something new could be considered multitasking.
In this case I was learning Livewire and Tailwind CSS.

Laravel is well-known to the various AI chat bots. I'm not using an AI powered editor yet, but pretty much every question had an answer.
