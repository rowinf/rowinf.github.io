I installed Ubuntu Linux and Omakub on my old Mac from 2015

## Why keep using an old computer?

When you have a Mac book for long enough, it stops getting OS updates. That happened to mine some time last year. I got the warning that my computer would no longer receive security updates, making it vulnerable to malware. The warning also mentioned that some software could stop working. I noticed Microsoft Teams would work, but MS Updater that gets installed along with it would run into a crash loop until I removed it from my computer.

Prior to attempting this, I had Ubuntu on my Windows gaming desktop. I have no time for games anymore, and I have trouble putting a game down once I pick it up. I already knew that I could use Ubuntu for my developer work. Once Omakub was released last year, I knew Ubuntu could be a great developer machine with very little set up time.

My Mac book was top of the line when I got it. Most software doesn't need more than 16gb RAM and 512gb of storage. I had a replacement battery right at the end of its warranty, and I got a new charger. Upgrading is good, but maybe not just right now. The longer I can wait, the bigger the upgrade.

## How did it go?

I ran into a graphics issue in the installer where large parts of the screen turned white. Searching the webs for an answer suggested changing some kernel settings, but I did not do these things. First, I tried starting the installer in graphics safe-mode and that got me through the installation process. Installing went off without a problem.

After installation was complete, I installed Omakub. Again, large parts of the screen would turn white and I couldn't see what some windows were displaying. Reinstalling Ubuntu and Omakub resolved this! Ubuntu now works on my laptop, and it's **nice**. 

Ubuntu itself is great for developers. Omakub takes care of a lot of the setup and installation of software. Snaps are getting better all the time. The process of installing software remains my biggest complaint in Ubuntu. Switching between snap, apt, or adding a ppa to install what I need is not fun.

## Will it last?

WILL I BREAK DOWN AND GET A NEW MAC? Maybe one day, but not today.

Personally, I'm happy this computer has been with me for 10 years. I doubt it'll last another 10 years, but I will try anything to extend the life a little bit longer. The future could be radically different from the present. We might have repairable laptops that last 20+ years, or maybe we won't have laptops at all.

## Conclusion?

Highly recommend trying Ubuntu on your old laptop. Highly recommend getting the most you can out of he computers you have, without opening yourself up to malware on an outdated operating system.
